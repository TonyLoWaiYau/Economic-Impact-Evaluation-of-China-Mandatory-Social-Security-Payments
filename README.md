# Economic Impact Evaluation of China's Mandatory Social Security Payments
Beginning September 1, 2025, mainland China will enforce mandatory social insurance regulations, invalidating any prior agreements that allowed employers and employees to opt out of contributing. This policy effectively reduces workersâ€™ take-home pay and increases labor costs for businesses, thereby dampening both consumption and production. To better understand these macroeconomic consequences, this study introduces a model that quantifies the impact of mandatory social insurance under various assumptions.
# Data
Annual growth rates of social security fund revenue (ssf), industrial production (ip), disposable income (di), and retail sales (rs) from 1990 to 2024.

# Model
In this study, I use a Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVAR) framework, which is well-suited for capturing complex dynamic relationships among macroeconomic variables while mitigating the risk of over-parameterization. To address potential small-sample bias, I include a Minnesota prior, thereby guiding the model toward more plausible parameter estimates and reducing overfitting. Because the data display signs of nonstationarity, I further incorporate a sum-of-coefficients prior to help stabilize the estimated relationships over time. Lastly, I adopt a hierarchical hyperparameter approach that allows the priors to remain data-driven, minimizing subjective judgment in the estimation process.
